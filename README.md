4. Credit EDA Case study using Python and Data science libs like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, etc.

5. Ecommerce Churn prediction using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest in PySpark

6. Built a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

7. Built a Gesture recognition model to develop a feature in the smart TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

8. Capstone project: This Capstone project is based on the domain of the telecom sector. You will be working with a telecom data set and will be required to develop a model to help a company run different marketing campaigns and data monetisation activities around it. So, let's try to understand the biggest challenge faced by the company in the telecom sector. Suppose XYZ Company, a telecom giant, wants to conduct some customer-driven campaigns as per certain users' gender and age preferences. However, the company may not rely on the Aadhaar information provided by the users at the time of purchasing SIM cards. So, in this Capstone Project, you will be predicting the demographics of certain users (gender and age) based on their app download and usage behaviour.
The data set was collected from a software development kit (SDK) that was integrated within the users' mobile applications. It serves under the service term between the Network Provider and the mobile app developers. The complete information of an individual user of an app has not been not provided due to privacy protection laws; therefore, you are required to build a model using the information provided on the users' application download and usage behaviour. Please treat the users' gender and age as real ground truth for prediction. In this particular Capstone project, you are required to build a model that will predict the demographics of certain users, i.e., their age and gender. For building this model, you have been provided with the data on the users' app downloads and user behaviour. This data will give you information on the details of the mobile phone owned by the users, the activities performed by the users, their GPS coordinates, etc. Now, your aim is to predict the age and the gender of a particular user using this data. Once you have predicted the gender and age for each user, your next task will be to map that particular user to the given target-specific ad campaigns. These campaigns aim to improve customer experience and open avenues for revenue generation through cross-selling and upselling activities, and for partnership with other companies for data monetisation activities.
